DESCRIPTION :

As part of my internship, I developed an interactive quiz application designed to enhance user engagement through dynamic, real-time interactions. The application is built using core web technologies: HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and ensuring a responsive, user-friendly interface, and JavaScript for implementing the interactive features.

Key features of the application include:

-Interactive Quiz Interface: Users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback on their answers, allowing them to track their progress throughout the quiz.
-Dynamic Content: The questions, answers, and results are dynamically loaded and updated using JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.
-Feedback Mechanism: After each question, users receive real-time feedback to help improve their learning experience, including correct/incorrect notifications and the ability to review answers.
-User-Centric Design: The application has been designed to provide an intuitive, engaging user experience with clean visuals, simple navigation, and interactive elements.
